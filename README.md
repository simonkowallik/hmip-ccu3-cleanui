# hmip-ccu3-userui
This user script modifies the UI look&feel.

I put this together to improve the UI to my personal liking. It's not perfect and it doesn't work for all elements.
I've created it based on CCU3 version 3.47.18 and Chrome 77, it might or might not work with earlier or later versions.
The script didn't receive much time, so consider it a hack.. :-)

Feel free to customize and improve it, I'm looking forward for your pull request.

## Install

You need a user script manager (tampermonkey, greasemonkey), you can install the script from [openuserjs.org/scripts/simonk/hmip-ccu3-cleanui](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/simonk/hmip-ccu3-cleanui) as well.
